= Local TLS Certificate is about to expire email alert

_Task_: When local to the Fortigate certificate is about to expire (10 days
ahead), send an email alert. The stitch does not care what this certificate is
used for - SSL VPN, or admin GUI access.

NOTE: Requires FortiOS 7.2 or newer.

* Set how early before the expiration to alert, in days (the default is already 
set on most versions to 14 days):

----
config vpn certificate setting
    set cert-expire-warning 10
end
----


* Trigger:

----
config system automation-trigger
    edit "CertToExpire_trigger"
        set event-type local-cert-near-expiry
    next
end
----


* Action (email alert):

----
config system automation-action
    edit "CertIsAboutToExpire_alert"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "Fortigate certificate is about to expire"
    next
end
----

* Stitch, tying all the above together:

----
config system automation-stitch
    edit "CertificateToExpire_stitch"
        set trigger "CertToExpire_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "CertIsAboutToExpire_alert"
            next
        end
    next
end
