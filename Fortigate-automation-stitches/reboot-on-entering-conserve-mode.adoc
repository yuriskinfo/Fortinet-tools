= Reboot Fortigate on entering Conserve Mode

_Task_: Reboot Fortigate each time it enters the Conserve Mode.

WARNING: Be aware that rebooting the Fortigate may or may not solve the issue of Conserve Mode. In the case it does not, you may cause Fortigate to do endless cycle of Conserve Mode -> Reboot -> Conserve Mode. Use with caution.



* Create trigger for the event:

----
config system automation-trigger
    edit "ConserveModeOn_trigger"
        set event-type low-memory
    next
----

* Action to actually reboot the firewall, using the command `exec reboot`:

----
config sys automation-aciton   
         edit "RebootMe"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script "exec reboot"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

* Stitch to tie all the above:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "ScheduledReboot_stitch"
        set trigger "ConserveModeOn_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "RebootMe"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----
