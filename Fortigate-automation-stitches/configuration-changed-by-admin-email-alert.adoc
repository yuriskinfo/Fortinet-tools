= Send alert on Fortigate configuration changed by administrator without details

_Task_: Each time any configuration is being changed send an email. 

NOTE: This alert will only contain a message "Configuration changed" with the
username and IP of the administrator, but will *not* contain what changes were
made. Additionally, this stitch will fire only *after* the administrator having
made changes logs out of the Fortigate. That is, if say admin session will last
hours, only after logging out will we receive an alert.



* Trigger:

----
config sys automation-trigger
    edit "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        set event-type config-change
    next
end
----

* Action - email alert:

----
config sys automation-action
    edit "ConfigChanged_email"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "%%log.logdesc%%"
    next
end
----

* Stitch:

----
config system automation-stitch
    edit "ConfigChanged"
        set status disable
        set trigger "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ConfigChanged_email"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
