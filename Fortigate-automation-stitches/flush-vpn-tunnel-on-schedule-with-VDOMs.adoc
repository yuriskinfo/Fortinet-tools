= Flush IPSec VPN tunnel on schedule with VDOMs enabled

_Task_: Flush VPN IPSec tunnel by name daily at 17:10 to bypass the FortiOS 7.4.x bug on Fortigate 100F/200F of tunnel being up but no traffic passing inside it. The VPN tunnel name here is _VPN-TO-US_ (name of the Phase1 interface).

NOTE: When VDOMs enabled the only difference is in the Action - before running the `flush` command, you have to enter the VDOM where the VPN tunnel is located. Without VDOMs - just remove 1st 2 lines in the action _config vdom_ and _edit <VDOM name>_. 


* Create an action to run command `diagnose vpn ike gateway flush name <VPN-name>`

----
config sys automation-action
    edit "ScheduleVPNtoUSRefresh"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script "config vdom
edit root
diagnose vpn ike gateway flush name VPN-TO-US
"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

* Create a daily schedule to run the stitch at 17:10

----

config sys   automation-trigger
    edit "Daily_trigger"
        set trigger-type scheduled
        set trigger-hour 17
        set trigger-minute 10
    next
end
----


* Connect trigger with action into a stitch:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "RefreshVPNUS"
        set trigger "Daily_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ScheduleVPNtoUSRefresh"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----
